# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Trieu Nguyen and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science

### CPSC 120

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-ivan-and-trieu)

Lab 6 part 2 was one of my favorites because it involves practical application of command-line arguments, which helps me better grasp program input. I developed my ability to handle errors better by learning how to evaluate and validate user inputs quickly. The learning process was made fun and memorable by the simplicity of the sandwich-ordering concept.

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-ashton-trieu)

Lab 7 part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because it uses date calculations in a real-world setting. My comprehension of handling date-related functions and command-line inputs has increased as a result. The lab's focuses on modularity, which is demonstrated by the unique functions like "DateDifference" and "PrintDate" improved code structure and readability.This has strengthened my understanding for the usefulness of its date calculating application.

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-trieu-and-faizan)

Lab 10 part 1 is my third favorite lab.The practical use of file input/output and integer manipulation makes this lab stand out. It improved my comprehension of C++ prime number verification, file management, and string reversal. The combination of practical applications, engaging tasks, and emphasis on code quality made this lab an enjoyable and enriching learning experience.
